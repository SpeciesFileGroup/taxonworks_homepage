### Our vision
From observation to archive, TaxonWorks touches every step of the taxonomy 
process.  

Capture your early observations, images and notes. Collaboratively refine, 
validate, and grow your datasets. Turn your discoveries into polished 
conclusions faster. Integrate data across your career, and hand it off to 
your protégé. Spend more time researching, and less time with the mundane.
