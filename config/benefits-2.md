### For scientists and developers

We seek to surround TaxonWorks with scientists who can affect change in the 
tools they use, and software carpenters who can affect change in science 
through their contributions.  

The TaxonWorks community is built around an open software ecosystem that 
facilitates participation at many levels, and expertise from scientists at 
every stage in their careers.
